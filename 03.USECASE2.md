# Using `git revert` in Git: A Practical Example

In Git, `git revert` is used to create a new commit that undoes the changes made by a previous commit. This is useful when you need to undo a specific commit without altering the commit history.

## Practical Example

### Scenario

You have made a commit to the `master` branch that introduces a bug. You want to undo this commit by creating a new commit that reverts the changes introduced by the problematic commit.

### Steps

1. **Identify the commit to revert:**

   Use `git log` to find the hash of the commit you want to revert. For example, assume the commit hash is `abc1234`.

   ```sh
   $ git log
   commit abc1234
   Author: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
   Date:   Thu Jun 23 12:34:56 2023 +0000

       Introduced a bug
   ```

2. **Revert the commit:**

   Use `git revert` followed by the commit hash to create a new commit that undoes the changes.

   ```sh
   $ git revert abc1234
   ```

   This command opens the default text editor for you to edit the commit message for the revert commit. After saving and closing the editor, a new commit is created that reverts the changes introduced by `abc1234`.

3. **Push the changes to the remote repository:**

   ```sh
   $ git push origin master
   ```

### Diagram

#### Reverting a Commit

Before revert:

```
A --- B --- C (master, abc1234)
```

After revert:

```
A --- B --- C --- D (master)
              \   ^
               \ /
            Revert of C
```

In this diagram, commit `D` is the new commit that reverts the changes introduced by commit `C`.

Using `git revert` in this way allows you to undo changes introduced by a specific commit without rewriting the commit history. This is particularly useful in collaborative environments where preserving the commit history is important.

Commit D does not revert the repository back to the state of commit B. Instead, it only undoes the changes made by commit C while preserving any changes made by commits after C. The history remains linear and retains all commits for a complete history.

# Key Difference Between Reset and Revert

## History Tracking
- git reset: Modifies the commit history by moving the branch pointer. It can discard commits if used with --hard.
- git revert: Creates a new commit that undoes the changes of a previous commit, preserving the commit history.

## Safety
- git reset: Can be disruptive if used in shared repositories, especially with --hard, as it can rewrite history and discard changes.
- git revert: Safe for use in shared repositories as it does not rewrite history.

## Use Case
- git reset: Useful for undoing changes in your local repository before sharing them, cleaning up commits, or adjusting the branch pointer.
- git revert: Ideal for undoing specific commits in a way that maintains a clear and accurate history, especially in collaborative environments.
