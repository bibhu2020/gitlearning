# Using `git cherry-pick` in Git: A Practical Example

In Git, `git cherry-pick` is used to apply changes from a specific commit (or commits) to the current branch. This is useful when you want to introduce changes from one branch into another without merging the entire branch.

## Practical Example

### Scenario

You have made a commit on a feature branch that you want to apply to the `master` branch without merging the entire feature branch.

### Steps

1. **Identify the commit to cherry-pick:**

   Use `git log` to find the hash of the commit you want to cherry-pick. For example, assume the commit hash is `abc1234`.

   ```sh
   $ git log
   commit abc1234
   Author: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
   Date:   Thu Jun 23 12:34:56 2023 +0000

       Added a new feature
   ```

2. **Check out the branch where you want to apply the commit:**

   ```sh
   $ git checkout master
   Switched to branch 'master'
   ```

3. **Cherry-pick the commit:**

   ```sh
   $ git cherry-pick abc1234
   ```

   This command applies the changes from commit `abc1234` to the `master` branch.

4. **Resolve any conflicts:**

   If there are any conflicts, Git will pause the cherry-pick process and prompt you to resolve them. After resolving conflicts, you can continue the cherry-pick:

   ```sh
   $ git add <resolved-files>
   $ git cherry-pick --continue
   ```

5. **Push the changes to the remote repository:**

   ```sh
   $ git push origin master
   ```

### Diagram

Before cherry-pick:

```
      master
        |
        V
A --- B --- C (feature-branch, abc1234)
```

After cherry-pick:

```
      master
        |
        V
A --- B --- D (master)
        \   ^
         \ /
          C (feature-branch, abc1234)
```

In this diagram, commit `D` on the `master` branch is the result of cherry-picking commit `C` from the `feature-branch`.

## Summary

Using `git cherry-pick` allows you to selectively apply changes from one branch to another. This is particularly useful when you want to introduce specific features or fixes from a feature branch into the main branch without merging all the changes from the feature branch.
