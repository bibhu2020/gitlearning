# Using `git rebase` to Squash Commits in Git

In Git, squashing commits means combining multiple commit entries into one. This is often done to clean up a messy commit history before merging a feature branch into the main branch. The `git rebase` command is commonly used for this purpose.

## Practical Example

### Scenario

You have a feature branch with multiple commits, and you want to squash them into a single commit before merging into the `master` branch.

### Steps

1. **View the commit history:**

   ```sh
   $ git log --oneline
   abc1234 Add feature part 3
   def5678 Add feature part 2
   ghi9101 Add feature part 1
   jkl1122 Initial commit
   ```

2. **Start an interactive rebase:**

   ```sh
   $ git rebase -i HEAD~3
   ```

   This command initiates an interactive rebase for the last 3 commits.

3. **Mark commits to squash:**

   In the interactive rebase editor, change `pick` to `squash` (or `s`) for the commits you want to squash:

   ```plaintext
   pick ghi9101 Add feature part 1
   squash def5678 Add feature part 2
   squash abc1234 Add feature part 3
   ```

   Save and close the editor.

4. **Edit the commit message:**

   Git will open a new editor window to edit the commit message for the squashed commits. You can combine the commit messages or create a new one:

   ```plaintext
   Add feature

   - Add feature part 1
   - Add feature part 2
   - Add feature part 3
   ```

   Save and close the editor to complete the rebase.

5. **Push the changes to the remote repository:**

   ```sh
   $ git push origin feature-branch --force
   ```

### Diagram

Before squashing:

```
      feature-branch
            |
            V
A --- B --- C --- D
```

After squashing:

```
      feature-branch
            |
            V
A --- B --- E
```

In this diagram, commit `E` is the result of squashing commits `C` and `D` into a single commit.

## Summary

- **Squashing Commits**: Combines multiple commits into one to clean up commit history.
- **Interactive Rebase**: Use `git rebase -i` to interactively squash commits.
- **Push with Force**: After squashing commits, use `git push --force` to update the remote branch.

Understanding how to squash commits helps maintain a clean and readable commit history, making it easier for others to understand the changes in your project.
