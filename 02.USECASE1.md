# Use Case: Correcting a Mistake in Recent Commits Using `git reset`

Using `git reset` can be a powerful tool for adjusting your commit history. Let's consider a practical use case where you might want to use `git reset`.

## Scenario

Imagine you are working on a feature branch and you realize that the last three commits contain some mistakes or unwanted changes. You want to undo these commits and make corrections. Here's how you can use `git reset` to achieve this.

1. You have the following commit history:
    ```
    A -- B -- C -- D -- E -- F -- G (feature)
    ```

2. Commits `E`, `F`, and `G` contain mistakes that you want to correct.

## Steps to Correct the Mistakes

### Step 1: Reset to a Previous Commit

You decide to undo the last three commits (`E`, `F`, and `G`). To do this, you use `git reset` to move `HEAD` and the current branch pointer back to commit `D`.

```sh
git reset --soft HEAD~3
```

- `--soft`: This option keeps your changes in the working directory and staging area.
- `HEAD~3`: This points to the commit three steps back from `HEAD` (commit `D`).

After this command, your commit history will look like this:

```
A -- B -- C -- D (feature)
```

But the changes from `E`, `F`, and `G` will still be in your working directory and staged for commit.

### Step 2: Review and Correct Changes

Now, you can review and make corrections to the changes from the last three commits. Open your files and make the necessary modifications.

### Step 3: Stage and Commit the Corrected Changes

Once you have corrected the changes, you can add them to the staging area and create a new commit.

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Corrected changes from commits E, F, and G"
```

Your new commit history will look like this:

```
A -- B -- C -- D -- H (feature)
```

Where `H` is the new commit containing the corrected changes.

## Explanation of Other Reset Options

### `--mixed` (default)

If you had used `git reset --mixed HEAD~3`, your changes would be removed from the staging area but kept in the working directory. This would allow you to selectively add files back to the staging area before committing.

### `--hard`

If you had used `git reset --hard HEAD~3`, both your staging area and working directory would be reset to match commit `D`. This means all changes from commits `E`, `F`, and `G` would be lost, so use this option with caution.

## Summary

- `git reset --soft HEAD~3`: Moves `HEAD` back three commits, keeps changes staged.
- `git reset --mixed HEAD~3`: Moves `HEAD` back three commits, keeps changes in the working directory.
- `git reset --hard HEAD~3`: Moves `HEAD` back three commits, discards changes in the working directory and staging area.

By using `git reset`, you can effectively correct mistakes in recent commits, giving you the flexibility to manage your commit history and ensure your repository stays clean and accurate.
