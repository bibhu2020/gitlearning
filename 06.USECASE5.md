# Git Rebase: Updating Feature Branch with `git rebase`

In Git, `git rebase` is used to reapply commits on top of another base commit. This can be useful when you want to update a feature branch with the latest changes from the main branch (`master`), while keeping a cleaner commit history.

## Use Case: Rebasing `feature-branch` onto `master`

1. **Check out `master` and pull latest changes:**

   ```sh
   $ git checkout master
   $ git pull origin master
   ```

2. **Check out `feature-branch` and rebase onto `master`:**

   ```sh
   $ git checkout feature-branch
   $ git rebase master
   ```

   This replays the commits from `feature-branch` on top of the latest `master`, effectively incorporating the changes from `master` into your feature branch.

3. **Resolve any conflicts:**

   If there are any conflicts, Git will pause the rebase process and prompt you to resolve them. After resolving conflicts, you can continue the rebase:

   ```sh
   $ git rebase --continue
   ```

4. **Complete the rebase:**

   Once the rebase is complete, your `feature-branch` will be up-to-date with `master`, and you can push your changes:

   ```sh
   $ git push origin feature-branch
   ```

### Diagram

Before Rebase:

```
                (master)
                    |
                    V
A --- B --- C --- D (feature-branch)
```

After Rebase:

```
                          (master)
                              |
                              V
A --- B --- C --- D --- E' (feature-branch)
```

In this example, `E'` represents the same changes as `D` but applied on top of the latest `master` commit. The commit `D` is abandoned in favor of the new commit `E'`.

Using `git rebase` in this way can help maintain a cleaner commit history by incorporating changes from `master` into feature branches before merging them back.
